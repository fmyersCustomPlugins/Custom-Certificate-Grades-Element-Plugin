# Read Me First

## ⚠️ Do NOT use the green "Code" button to download this plugin

The green **Code > Download ZIP** button (and the auto-generated "Source code"
files on the Releases page) will **not** install correctly in Moodle.

## ✅ Install from the Releases page instead

1. Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** page for this repo.
2. Under the latest release, download **`customcertelement_quarterlytotals.zip`**
   from the **Assets** list.
3. In Moodle, log in as a site administrator and go to:
   **Site administration > Plugins > Install plugins**
4. Drag in `customcertelement_quarterlytotals.zip` (or click to browse and
   select it).
5. Click **Install plugin from the ZIP file**, then **Continue** on the
   plugin check screen.
6. Click **Upgrade Moodle database now** to finish.
7. Open a certificate template's editor, choose **Quarterly totals** from
   the "Add element" dropdown, and position it. Add it once - it
   automatically lists every course the student is enrolled in.

No FTP, SSH, or direct file access is needed — the whole install happens
through the Moodle admin UI.

## More details

See [`quarterlytotals/README.md`](quarterlytotals/README.md) in this repo
for full documentation, including how to auto-detect vs. hand-pick
courses, exclude specific courses, toggle which columns show, and set
colours site-wide.
